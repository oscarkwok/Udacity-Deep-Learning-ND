I was selected by Udacity out of thousands of students to be awarded a scholarship to complete the 'Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch' course, with a chance to move on to the full Deep Learning nanodegree. 

The criteria for being awarded the nanodegree was to successfully complete the scholarship course and provide quality engagement in the Slack community for all the students. 

I was ultimately one of the handful of people awarded the full Deep Learning nanodegree as I was able to complete the course and also contributed to the Slack community by becoming a channel leader where I moderateed discussions, answered technical/non-technical questions, and created initiatives to help the students get to know each other better.

Looking forward to sharing my work from the nanodegree here!
